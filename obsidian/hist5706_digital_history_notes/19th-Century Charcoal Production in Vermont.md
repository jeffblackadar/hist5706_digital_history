## Notes

"Charcoal was cheap and relatively easy to make (as long as the forests remained boundless), and being light in weight, large quantities could be transported great distances with moderate effort."P15

"Since most early iron- works were built next to good running streams, they were usually situated in or near a good stand of forest. Thus the distance and time was small between chopping trees, charring the wood, and delivering the charcoal to the works in the very early days of the industry." P15

"Only live trees were cut for making charcoal, and they were best cut in winter while the sap was held in the roots. This reduced the amount of pitch that had to be burned off and increased the quality of the charcoal. It also reduced the weight of the logs, lessening the wood- choppers' efforts." P15

"Leaves, small branches, and some- times the bark were stripped away, making more efficient use of the space in the kiln for more solid pieces of wood. The wood was cut into exactly 4-foot lengths. Diameter was not considered of much importance except that it be as uniform as possible, and very large pieces were split." P16

4 During the colonial and post-colonial period, slaves chopped wood at southern ironworks. By the Vermont ironworks era, woodchopping for the charcoal industry provided off-season work for farmers, some of whom periodically harvested stands from their own woodlots for sale to charcoal burners. Wood- chopping also provided employment for ironworkers who might otherwise be unemployed during winter shutdown periods due to frozen, ice-covered waterwheels"p16

"The price paid per cord for woodcutting varied with place and time. A Vermont woodchopper considered 250 per cord good wages, while his Missouri cousins thought double that was still poor compensation." P16

" Cutting saplings and crooked timber cost somewhat more. Tall timber one to two feet in diameter were more profitable to cut."P16

"Maple, sycamore, and knotty timber were more expensive to cut than oak, beech, hickory, and pine."P16

"Hillsides were cleared with more difficulty than level ground and demanded higher wages."P16

"A good woodchopper was expected to average three cords a day, a cord being a stack of logs 4 feet wide and high by 8 feet long" P16

"An acre contained an average of 30 cords of wood,"

"Capen Leonard of Chittenden published a pamphlet in 1848
which contained a complex formula for calculating how much wood was in a pile: "Multiply together half the diameter and half the circumference, divide the product by 32 (if the wood be four feet in length), and the quotient will be the number of cords."7 A table in the pamphlet that translated piles of wood with circumferences from 20 to 160 feet into cords of wood made everything much easier for the collier. It took much of the guesswork out of the problem and bypassed the formula. In the table, a typical 4-foot-high woodpile measuring 30 feet in diameter (94 feet in circumference) yielded 22 cords."

Wood:
"The specific gravity of the wood made into charcoal was very important to the ironmaster. Hardwood weighs more than softwood and was preferred by blast furnace opera- tions. Bloomeries preferred charcoal made from soft- wood.8 Since the quality of the iron produced in a blast furnace was limited by the height of the stack (for better draft), this in turn was limited by the crushing resistance of the charcoal. A successful iron production was possible only where the hardest woods were used, resulting in the hardest and heaviest charcoal."P17

Manufacture
"Charcoal was made by controlled burning of the wood. The burning was not allowed to progress beyond active smoldering, otherwise the entire effort would be consumed in flames. Properly controlled smoldering provided enough heat to burn off all the spirits and pitch in the wood, resulting in nearly 100 percent carbon remaining as charcoal" P17

Meiler construction:
"The uniformity of the charring process also guaranteed the uniformity of the charcoal's quality. Var- ious configurations of wood stacking and techniques of wood burning were tried in the quest for both quality and predictable uniformity"P17

Meiler dimensions
"In the charcoal mound, wood was carefully stacked in a 30- to 40-foot diameter pile, leaving an approximately one- foot-diameter space in the middle to act as a chimney. When stacked, the wood was 10 to 14 feet high at the center (figure" P17

"A mound of these dimensions used 30 cords of wood, the equivalent of a one-acre woodlot." P18

Time
"It took about a week to char the wood, depending on the weather, type of wood, and the skill of the collier." P18

The collier's burning season ran from the end of one winter to the start of the next. Charcoal would deteriorate if left to accumulate, so it was made only a few weeks before it was needed at the forge.15 "p18


"It took a well- organized and alert collier to master the operation of the number of mounds he had to tend" P18

"A good collier had to juggle a number of duties, alternately charging and discharging mounds while tending to the vent holes of others. The mounds were built 100 or so feet from each other, to give working room and prevent the spread of fire p18
