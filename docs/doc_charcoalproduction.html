<h1>Charcoal Production Model</h1>
<h2>Model: CharcoalProductionMap class</h2>

    </p> The model contains these four classes, detailed below.
    
    </p> Map / CharcoalProductionMap Class:
    
    Represents the hex grid of cells. The grid is represented by a 2-dimensional array of cells with adjacency rules specific to hexagons.

    </p> Furnace / Furnace Class:
    
    The furnace is at the center of the map.
    When colliers cut down the forest to make charcoal in a neighbouring cell, that cell's forest's age becomes 0 and is not mature.

    </p> Map Hexagon / LandCell Class:
    
    Each hexagon represents a single area of forest in the simulation.
    
    The land cell is most often a forest that can be mature (above the age of forest maturity and ready to cut) or young (not read to cut).
    The land cell where the furnace is located is not a forest.
    The age of the forest increases each year or model step. The color of the cell is determined by land cell state and forest age. 
    A land cell may contain a charcoal hearth.

    </p> Charcoal Hearth / CharcoalHearth Class: 
    
    A land cell hexagon may contain a charcoal hearth. A charcoal hearth may have a states of: built meiler (a pile of wood), fired charcoal hearth or relict.

<h3>Furnace</h3>
The furnace is at the center of the map. It is unforested. Charcoal hearths can't be built on the furnace cell. In some simulations the furnace closes if it does not receive a sufficient amount of charcoal that year.

<h2>Agent: LandCell class</h2>
 
    Represents a single area of forest in the simulation.

    The land cell is most often a forest that can be mature (above the age of a mature forest and ready to cut) or young (not read to cut)
    The land cell where the furnace is located is not a forest.
    The age of the forest increases each year and is displayed in the cell. The color of the cell is determined by land cell state or forest age.

<h2>Agent: CharcoalHearth class</h2>
 
    Represents a single charcoal hearth that is situated in an area of forest (LandCell) in the simulation.

    The charcoal hearth may be in any type of forest and has three states: 
    Active = 1: The meiler is constructed from wood cut in neighboring cell and fired to produce charcoal.
    Relict = 0: A charcoal hearth that was fired previously.

<h3>Charcoal Hearths</h3>

A charcoal hearth has 2 states: Relict (dormant) and Active (built and fired).

<h4>Relict Charcoal Hearth</h4>
A relict charcoal hearth can be located on any type of forest cell.

<h4>Model Logic References</h4>
<p>[1] Robert B. Gordon, <i>American Iron, 1607-1900</i>, (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2019), 40. This out of business function in the model is based on the example the Union blast furnace consuming all of the wood available in the surrounding forest and going out of business.
<p>[2] Victor R. Rolando, "19th-Century Charcoal Production in Vermont," IA. The Journal of the Society for Industrial Archeology 17, no. 2 (1991): 15. Charcoal was produced nearby where trees were cut and delivered to the furnace soon after it was made.
<p>[3] Rolando, "19th-Century Charcoal Production in Vermont," 16. An acre of forest contained 30 cords of wood for charcoal on average.
