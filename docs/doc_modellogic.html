<h4>Model Logic References</h4>
<p>[1] Robert B. Gordon, <i>American Iron, 1607-1900</i>, (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2019), 40. This out of business function in the model is based on the example the Union blast furnace consuming all of the wood available in the surrounding forest and going out of business.
<p>[2] Victor R. Rolando, "19th-Century Charcoal Production in Vermont," IA. The Journal of the Society for Industrial Archeology 17, no. 2 (1991): 15. Charcoal was produced nearby where trees were cut and delivered to the furnace soon after it was made.
<p>[3] Rolando, "19th-Century Charcoal Production in Vermont," 16. An acre of forest contained 30 cords of wood for charcoal on average.
