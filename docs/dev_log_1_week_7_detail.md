# Devlog Week 7 Details

## Documentation, Comments and Programmer's Block

I was reluctant to restart work, I wanted to get a good code/comments and documentation structure.

I'm using Mermaid's class structure
https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/classDiagram
and then exporting comments into it.

My hope is comment once, document everywhere.

documenter.py is working well, exporting comments into markdownish syntax for Mermaid to use.

## Clean up

I've cleaned up some class and variable names for the prototype model.
