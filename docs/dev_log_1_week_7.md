# Devlog Week 7

This Digital History project will be an agent-based simulation of charcoal production in the forests of the eastern United States 1700-1945. I would like to use this to explore the scale of labour involvement and to simulate the pattern of construction of charcoal hearths to compare it to the archaeological record for a locality, such as surrounding [Catoctin Furnace, Maryland](https://www.nps.gov/cato/learn/historyculture/furnace.htm). 

For this project, I selected [Mesa](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) an agent-based modelling framework for python. I'll write more about my choices in the paradata document.

I set up Mesa and made a prototype model. I wanted to make a simple model as a basis to look at charcoal production. I modelled a simple saw mill that is situated in the middle of the forest and consumes trees from surrounding areas of land.
