<h1>Mill Model</h1>
<h2>Model: MillMap class</h2>

    </p> Map:
    Represents the hex grid of cells. The grid is represented by a 2-dimensional array of cells with adjacency rules specific to hexagons.

    </p> Mill:
    The saw mill is at the center of the map.
    When the mill's loggers cut down the forest in a neighbouring cell, that cell's forest's age becomes 0. 
    For the mill to stay running, it needs to harvest a set number of mature forest cells each year. If the mill fails to harvest enough forest cells, the mill closes and it state changes to 0 (stopped/closed)

    </p> land Cell:
    Each hexagon represents a single area of forest in the simulation.
    
    The land cell is most often a forest that can be mature (above the age of a mature forest and ready to cut) or young (not read to cut)
    The land cell where the mill is is not a forest.
    The age of the forest increases each year and is displayed in the cell. The color of the cell is determined by land cell state or forest age.
